2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_Sampler_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_Sampler_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_Sampler_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_Sampler_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_Sampler_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_Sampler_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_Sampler_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_Sampler_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Sampler_Characterization_i/AXI_Sampler_0/U0/TestSampler_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/axi_rvalid_mem_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Sampler_Characterization_i/AXI_Sampler_0/U0/TestSampler_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/axi_rvalid_mem_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
