Notes from 11-19-2022 Project Revisit:

The throughput tests are a close match the test results in /ETC/_docs/Graduate Project Measurement logs/Throughput/Injector_throughput
The latency tests are a close match the test results in /ETC/_docs/Graduate Project Measurement logs/Throughput/Injector_Latency

The test results do not match exactly but this is due to some randomness in latency and interrupt handling.

The test results in P4 can be trusted.
