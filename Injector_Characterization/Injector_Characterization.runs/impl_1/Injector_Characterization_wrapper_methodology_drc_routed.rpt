2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_Injector_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_Injector_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_Injector_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_Injector_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_Injector_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_Injector_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_Injector_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_Injector_Characterization_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led2 relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>
